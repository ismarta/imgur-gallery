# imgur-gallery

This repository contains a simple application where photos can be uploaded to Imgur. It includes integration with the operating system's camera as well as the file manager. Additionally, it features an image gallery where you can view the uploaded images and delete those you no longer want. The following technologies have been used for this purpose:

* SwiftUI
* MVVM 
* Clean architecture
* Combine framework

Note: The example uses the Imgur API (https://apidocs.imgur.com). To run the example, you need to register to obtain the necessary information:

* Client ID
* Client Secret

and add them to the ApiDetails class.
